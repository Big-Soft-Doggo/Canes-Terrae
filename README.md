# Canes-Terrae
_A small Terraria resource pack! For the vanilla version of the game, this changes only a few assets to some silly alternate version!_

Currently, there are only around **10 major changes** to the game's textures, buffs, descriptions, and item names! Most of these are light-hearted fun changes like swapping a rare cloud asset with an image of my husband!

A lot of these images are made with the tool **Aseprite** on Steam! Sorry for how silly or wild some of the changes are, I might push a more tame version of the assets. This mod does include Furry iconography and terms related to Macro content! Everything within this asset pack is **Safe for Work**!
